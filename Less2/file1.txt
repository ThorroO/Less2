The exhausted flower under the stone of faith
Lies motionless, distorted in agony,
Only the sick Messiah, without knowing the measure,
Without sleep and without care, he painted patterns,

The aster saw the vital energy,
Pierced by a cutting ray of light,
And the frail hand of a mad artist
And now rests forever, holding the silver

A cracked brush of green paint,
With which he painted a patterned sea
Of flowers where there is eternity, where there is no flaw,
As if he had ever been happy.
